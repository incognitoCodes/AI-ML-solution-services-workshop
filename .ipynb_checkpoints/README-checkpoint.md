Lets get started!


### Virtual Proctor
Virtual Proctor is a solution that leverages Amazon Rekognition to show a scalable way to conduct online testing.

It shows how you can implement rules such as:
- Detecting objects of interest (such as mobile phone)
- Detecting the number of people present
- Recognizing the person who is taking a test
- Detecting unsafe content (such as explicit adult content or violent content)

### Liveness Detection 
The **Liveness Detection Framework** solution helps you implement liveness detection mechanisms into your applications by means of an extensible architecture. It comprises a set of APIs to process and verify liveness challenges, along with two different types of challenges provided as reference implementations. In addition to those, you can extend the framework and implement your own liveness detection algorithms. This solution also includes a sample web application fully integrated with the APIs. 

Get started with [2-liveness-detection](./2-liveness-detection/README.md) module. </br>


### Churn Prediction using SageMaker Canvas (no-code AI)
This helps you build a prediction model for student drop-outs using Amazon SageMaker Canvas. Canvas is a no-code AI tool that provides a visual point-and-click interface and allows you to build models and generate accurate ML predictions on your own without requiring any ML experience or having to write a single line of code.

### Document Understanding Solution
The Document Understanding Solution (DUS) delivers an easy-to-use web application that ingests and analyzes files, extracts text from documents, identifies structural data (tables, key value pairs), extracts critical information (entities), and creates smart search indexes from the data. Additionally, files can be uploaded directly to and analyzed files can be accessed from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your AWS account.
