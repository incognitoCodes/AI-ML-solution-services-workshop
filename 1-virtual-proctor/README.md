# Virtual Proctor using Amazon Rekognition

Proctoring is the act of supervising an exam or course online.

Using web-based applications, virtual proctoring platforms allow test takers to be virtually monitored by a human via the webcam on their computer. To increase the scale of the test taking and improve a human proctorâ€™s ability to monitor students, virtual proctoring services are now implementing AI/ML to support the human proctor.

## What you will learn?
Virtual Proctor is a solution that leverages Amazon Rekognition to show a scalable way to conduct online testing.

It shows how you can implement rules such as:
- Detecting objects of interest (such as mobile phone)
- Detecting the number of people present
- Recognizing the person who is taking a test
- Detecting unsafe content (such as explicit adult content or violent content)
You can also use [Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels-features/) to detect other custom objects of interest.

## Steps
- Navigate to [Virtual Proctor](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-rekognition-virtual-proctor) solution.
- Under *Deployment* > Click on *Launch on AWS* button next to *US East (N. Virgina) (us-east-1)* </br> ![launch_on_us_east_1](./images/launch_on_us_east_1.png)
- Under parameters, 
  - for *AdminEmail* enter your email address.
  - For *ObjectsOfInterestLabels* add *Book* and any other labels of interest.
- Follow all other steps as the guide to deploy the solution which takes about 5 minutes.
- Feel free to watch the [pre-recorded demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKVLrslta6k) until the deployment finishes.
