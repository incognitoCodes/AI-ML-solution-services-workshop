## Solutions
In this workshop, we will go through 4 to 6 solutions.

Lets get started!
### Virtual Proctor
Virtual Proctor is a solution that leverages Amazon Rekognition to show a scalable way to conduct online testing.

It shows how you can implement rules such as:
- Detecting objects of interest (such as mobile phone)
- Detecting the number of people present
- Recognizing the person who is taking a test
- Detecting unsafe content (such as explicit adult content or violent content)
